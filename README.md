# Iris-flower-classifier
A Vectorised Neural Network Classifier, To classify among the 3 types of Iris Flower using the following Data-Set
"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data"

Some Explation of variables are follows

Yactual_total -> the matrix representation of the actual outputs of the Entire set
                Iris-setosa = [1,0,0]
                Iris-versicolor = [0,1,0]
                 Iris-virginica = [0,0,1]
Yactual_train -> the matrix representation of the actual outputs of the training set
Yactual_test -> the matrix representation of the actual outputs of the test set

Yexp_train -> the matrix representation of the outputs done by the classifier on the training set
Yexp_test-> the matrix representation of the outputs done by the classifier on the Test set

efficiency -> The efficiency of the classifier on the test set (20% of the data set)
